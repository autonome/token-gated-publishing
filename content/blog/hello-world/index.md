This is my first post on my new fake blog! How exciting!

This is a token-gated collaborative blog that publishes content from people who own a valid Unlock [NFT membership](https://unlock-protocol.com/).

It will be published only if I own a valid key on the lock for the blog's config.

Want to write something for it? Just open a PR, add a `markdown` file to the `content/blog` repo, and make sure you sign a slug [using a tool like MyCrypto](https://app.mycrypto.com/sign-message).

You can configure the locks by editing the `gatsby-config.js` file.
