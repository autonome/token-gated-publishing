This is my first post on my new fake blog! How exciting!

This is a token-gated collaborative blog that publishes content from people who own a valid Unlock [NFT membership](https://unlock-protocol.com/).

It will be published only if I own a valid key on the lock for the blog's config.

Want to write something for it? Just open a PR, add a `markdown` file to the `content/blog` repo, and make sure you sign a slug [using a tool like MyCrypto](https://app.mycrypto.com/sign-message).

You can configure the locks by editing the `gatsby-config.js` file.

Right now, this blog is configured for people who have a membership to the rinkeby lock at `0x889559AD98a3438bA6D471491A8Cd9c7C4c640b6`. You can get one [by click here](https://app.unlock-protocol.com/checkout?redirectUri=https%3A%2F%2Ftokengatedpublishingmain.gatsbyjs.io%2F&paywallConfig=%7B%22locks%22%3A%7B%220x889559AD98a3438bA6D471491A8Cd9c7C4c640b6%22%3A%7B%22network%22%3A4%7D%7D%2C%22pessimistic%22%3Atrue%2C%22persistentCheckout%22%3Atrue%2C%22icon%22%3A%22https%3A%2F%2Flocksmith.unlock-protocol.com%2Flock%2F0x889559AD98a3438bA6D471491A8Cd9c7C4c640b6%2Ficon%22%7D).
